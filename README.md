### Welcome to (the new home of) UCanAccess

**UCanAccess** is a popular open-source pure Java JDBC driver capable of reading/writing Microsoft Access databases.

---

The project was originally developed by [Marco Amadei](https://sourceforge.net/u/jamadei/), Gord Thompson and others and hosted at Sourceforge until version 5.0.1 when development ceased in 2020 and activity on the project sadly died down.

UCanAccess is a very useful piece of software. It would be a shame to see it disappear.
As for myself, I have contributed to UCanAccess in the past and continue to use it to the present day.
I have reached out to my fellow developers but have not been able to reestablish contact thus far.
Therefore I have forked the latest available code base and make it available here at Github.
I hope to keep on maintaining and releasing it and so UCanAccess can continue to be useful and usable for all of us.

Your feedback, thoughts and contributions are very welcome.
